# Project: 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
## Description
This project about implementing a simple interpreter for interpret high level language like "python programming" using the application of stack & queue Data structure. The implementation focuses on implementing stack and queue functionalities using  linked list data structure using C programming language. The primary goal of the project is to create a command-line application named "monty" that simulates an interpreter for a high-level programming language by executing Monty ByteCodes files.

### General Info
- Project Name: 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
- Project Type: Command-line application
- Programming Language: C
- Platform: Ubuntu Linux (CLI)

### Project Concepts
In this project, we delve into the following concepts:
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) structures
- Stack and queue implementations using a doubly linked list
- Proper usage of global variables
- Compilation and Output

### Compilation and Output
To compile the "monty" application, use the following command:

- bash
- Copy code: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
- All output generated by the program should be printed on stdout.

### The Monty Language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language compiled into Monty ByteCodes files. These files have a .m extension and contain opcode instructions. Comments start with the '#' character.

### Usage
bash
$ ./monty file
Replace file with the path to the Monty ByteCodes file.

### Implemented_Functions
This project involves implementing the following opcode functions:

### Notes
Invalid opcode instructions will be reported with an error message.
The program handles division by zero scenarios.
All functions use malloc for memory allocation.
